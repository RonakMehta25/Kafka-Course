Kafka  Components

Topics

A stream of messages belonging to a particular category is called a topic. Data is stored in topics.

Topics are split into partitions. For each topic, Kafka keeps a mini-mum of one partition. Each such partition contains messages in an immutable ordered sequence. A partition is implemented as a set of segment files of equal sizes.
